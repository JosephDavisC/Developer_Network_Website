# 🌐 Developer Network Website (Dev.Net) — *Archived Project*

This is the official website that was built for **Dev.Net**, the **first-ever technology club launched at HighScope Indonesia**.  
The club was dedicated to fostering a love for **programming, design, video editing, and technology** among students.

⚠️ **Note:** The Dev.Net club is no longer operational, but this repository and website remain as a showcase of the project and my contribution to building a student tech community.

## 📖 About the Project
The Developer Network Website was created to serve as the central hub of the club.  
It was designed to:
- Provide students with tools, resources, and a supportive community.  
- Showcase the club’s **mission, vision, and team members**.  
- Represent Dev.Net publicly as the first student-led tech initiative in the school.  

This was also one of my earliest experiences in **web development, hosting, and leading a real community project**.
